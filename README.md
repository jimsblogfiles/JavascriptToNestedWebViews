My intent is to drop code in here as I go about my day to day routine. When I do something useful that works and I don't want to have recreate it I plan to put it here. Feel free to use anything you find here BUT at your own risk. Nothing here is a tutorial, hell it's probably wrong. If itâ€™s helpful to you that is awesome, but it is often taken out of context known only to me and dumped here. No refunds, exchanges, warranties, you get what you pay for... etc. etc.
